# 🧱 Stack Applications in Python

This program demonstrates three classic stack-based applications:

1. **Reverse a String**  
2. **Check Balanced Parentheses**  
3. **Undo Operations**  

It is a menu-driven Python script designed to help understand how stacks work in real-world scenarios.

## 🚀 Features Overview

### ✔ 1. Reverse a String
Uses a stack to reverse the characters of a given string:

- Push every character onto a stack  
- Pop all characters to build the reversed string  

### ✔ 2. Balanced Parentheses Checker
Validates whether an expression contains properly matched brackets:

- Supports: `()`, `{}`, `[]`  
- Uses stack push/pop behavior  
- Returns **Balanced** or **Not Balanced**

### ✔ 3. Undo Operation Simulator
Simulates a basic *UNDO* feature:

- Accepts a list of characters or `"UNDO"` commands  
- `"UNDO"` removes the last entered character  
- Returns the final text after all operations
